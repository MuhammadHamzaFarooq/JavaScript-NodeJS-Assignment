//Q45:
//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

const carInfo = (manufacturerName, modelName, number, color = null) => {
    return {
        manufacturerName,
        color,
        number,
        color: color ? color : "black"
    }
}

console.log(carInfo());
