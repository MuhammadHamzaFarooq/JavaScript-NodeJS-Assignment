//Q12:
//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
const friendsList = ["Mirza Ziayd Ahmed Baig", "Mavia Ali", "Salman Zakir", "Muhamamd Hammmad"];

for (let i in friendsList) {
    console.log(`${friendsList[i]} is my best friend`);
}
